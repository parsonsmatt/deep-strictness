-- Counting the number of cons-cells forced by supplying successively more well-
-- defined inputs to a function and finding out when it. This procedure takes
-- quadratic time to complete, as it re-evaluates the input function n times,
-- where n is the amount of the input list f requires to produce its output.
-- Because we know that f must be at least O(n), demandCount must be O(n^2).

      fstIfDefined = fmap fst . traverse teaspoon

-- NOTE: Notice the arguments we pass to demandCount. They are, in order:
-- a Context for b, a function from [a] -> b, and a [a]. We needn't separate
-- the Context from the function, but it makes it much more clear what the
-- intention is when using the function.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- To prevent the quadratic evaluation issue above, we instead instrument the
-- input to the function so that it updates a count stored in a single IORef.
-- This method is also described briefly in the article linked above.

    readIORef count

-- NOTE: A particular pattern in these kind of functions is the use of a single
-- do-block encased in a single unsafePerformIO. This limits the degree to which
-- we can get confused about sequencing of operations. If we need to ensure that
-- a particular value gets evaluated (to whnf) before we continue with the IO,
-- we can say "() <- return $! ...". The pattern match on () doesn't change the
-- strictness behavior here; it just makes sure that you're not accidentally
-- whnf-ing something with structure (you shouldn't be!). I've wrapped up this
-- idiom below:

evaluate :: () -> IO ()
evaluate () = return ()

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- However, just knowing the number of cons-cells forced in evaluation does not
-- always give us all the information we need. For instance, it tells us nothing
-- about the strictness of the function on the elements of the list. For more
-- complex data structures (e.g. trees), a single count of evaluations is quite
-- insufficient to reason about deep laziness.

-- What we need is a representation of a *demand* on a data structure, reified.
-- A demand on some ADT is that same ADT, but modified to interleave a Maybe in
-- every field of every data constructor. Demand on primitives is isomorphic to
-- unit.

-- The structure of a demand structure is:
-- For each type parameter of the original data structure, take a corresponding
-- type parameter representing the demand for that parameter. Each demand also
-- takes a final parameter representing the wrapper around each field: for
-- the internal mutable structures used in the implementation of our library,
-- this will be IORef; for the user-facing interface, this will be Identity.

-- TODO: f will *only* ever need to be instantiated at IORef and Identity.
-- It probably makes sense to just use two data structures, thus eliding the
-- Identity from the user's view of the world.

-- NOTE: Based on the structure of these types, we can certainly generically
-- derive their corresponding demand types. We should also be able to derive
-- Show, Eq, and Arbitrary instances, necessary for QuickCheck.

-- TODO: This definition is subtly wrong, in that it cannot represent or
-- instrument whether a nil constructor is forced. We need another case in
-- the ADT for ListDemand which contains a (f (Maybe (PrimDemand f)))
